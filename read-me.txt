Thanks for trying out Bootstrap 386 - The Most Advanced User Interface, period.

This WordPRess Theme was modeled after Bootstrap 386 found at: http://kristopolous.github.io/BOOTSTRA.386/index.html

This theme is a throw back to the 'good-ole-days' when computers were for computing and... stuff. What did we use computers for back in 1986 anyway?  Well if you find yourself pining for those days look no further!  Bootstrap 386 is built on the great work on Kristolopous and I give it to you now as the best wordpress theme, period.

Some things to note about this template:

- Navigation Menu Objects with Sub navigation are not clickable (this is true for all bootstrap templates)
- The top "navbar" navigation only supports 2 level anything beyond 2 level will not display


Enjoy!
